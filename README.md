# Vulnerability Report – Input Validation Bypass & Unicode Injection

**Type of Vulnerability:** Input Validation Bypass + Unicode Injection  
**Target:** Operating System Level (original name can be entered optionally)  
**The Area where it is located:** User input processing module / input parser

## Clear Definition

A certain module in the operating system processes the inputs received from the user without filtering them sufficiently. This allows the input validation mechanism to be bypassed by using special characters (including Unicode) and multi-byte characters.

For example:  
Characters – '₺*"'!?`  
Unicode – `\u20BA`, `\u202E`, '\U200F' etc.  
Combinations of these characters cause the system to go outside the boundaries that it expects.

## Possible Security Implications

- **Command Injection: ** If the input is transmitted directly to the system commands or to the shell level.
-**Buffer Overflow:** Multibyte characters may cause overflow.
- **Information Disclosure:** Blocked file contents or error messages can be accessed.
- **Path Manipulation / Directory Traversal:** The directory structure can be manipulated with Unicode.

## The Exploitation Method

The attacker can use the vulnerability with the following steps:

1. Prepares an input that contains non-standard, multibyte, or Unicode characters.
2. This input passes the input validation check because the system cannot distinguish these characters.
3. Then, the parser or processor behaves unexpectedly when processing this input.
4. As a result of this behavior, a crash (DoS), data disclosure, or code injection may occur.
